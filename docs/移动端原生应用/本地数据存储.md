# 本地数据存储

一个应用总会需要数据,产生数据,而手机作为一个个人终端,自然也就需要有数据的本地存取功能.

nativescript中数据存储常用的有两种方式

1. 利用文件系统
2. 利用数据存储接口

当然着两种方式本质上都是利用文件系统,毕竟数据存储接口也是建立在文件系统之上的,只是额外多了一层抽象.

本文的例子保存在[native-helloworld-localstore](https://github.com/hsz1273327/TutorialForFront-EndWeb/tree/native-helloworld-localstore)分支.这个例子由最开始的`native-helloworld`项目修改而来,我们用各种本地数据存储的方式来保存和提取要展示的数据.

这个例子中我们的数据就是三个电影,让我们先把这三个电影的信息提取出来然后在`models`目录下专注的演示各种本地数据存储.

我们可以用`json`文件保存下这些电影的信息,这需要

+ 设置`tsconfig.json`,在其中添加如下配置

    ```json
    {
    "compilerOptions": {
        ...
        "resolveJsonModule": true,
    },
    ...
    }
    ```

+ 姑且在根目录下新建`data`目录,保存我们的`flick.json`

    ```json

They became friends at the University of Colorado Boulder and collaborated on a musical film, Cannibal! The Musical (1993), their first experience with movie musicals. In 1997, they created the TV series South Park for Comedy Central and in 1999, the musical film South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut. The two had first thought of a fictionalized Joseph Smith, religious leader and founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, while working on an aborted Fox series about historical characters. Their 1997 film, Orgazmo, and a 2003 episode of South Park, 'All About Mormons', both gave comic treatment to Mormonism. Smith was also included as one of South Parks 'Super Best Friends', a Justice League parody team of religious figures like Jesus and Buddha."

Rudin advised the duo to see the musical Avenue Q on Broadway, finding the cast of marionettes in Team America similar to the puppets of Avenue Q. Parker and Stone went to see the production during that summer and the writer-composers of Avenue Q, Lopez and Jeff Marx, noticed them in the audience and introduced themselves. Lopez revealed that South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut was highly influential in the creation of Avenue Q. The quartet went for drinks afterwards, and soon found that each camp wanted to write something involving Joseph Smith. The four began working out details nearly immediately, with the idea to create a modern story formulated early on. For research purposes, the quartet took a road trip to Salt Lake City where they 'interviewed a bunch of missionaries—or ex-missionaries.' They had to work around Parker and Stones South Park schedule. In 2006, Parker and Stone flew to London where they spent three weeks with Lopez, who was working on the West End production of Avenue Q. There, the three wrote 'four or five songs' and came up with the basic idea of the story. After an argument between Parker and Marx, who felt he was not getting enough creative control, Marx was separated from the project.[10] For the next few years, the remaining trio met frequently to develop what they initially called The Book of Mormon: The Musical of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 'There was a lot of hopping back and forth between L.A. and New York,' Parker recalled."

Weve kept the best parts of the animated movie, but it really is a new musical.' The musical also adds characters not in the film. Additionally, Act 1 is set in Russia and Act 2 in Paris, 'which was everything modern Soviet Russia was not: free, expressive, creative, no barriers' according to McNally.The musical also omits the supernatural elements from the original film, including the character of Rasputin and his musical number 'In the Dark of the Night', although that songs melody is repurposed in the new number 'Stay, I Pray You', and introduces instead a new villain called Gleb, a general for the Bolsheviks who receives orders to kill Anya."

+ 在我们业务逻辑代码(`models`目录下)中使用如下语句导入这些数据

    ```ts
    import init_data from '../data/flick.json'

    ...
    ```

## 移动端本地数据的存储

通常一个合规的应用应该相对于其他应用在数据上是独立的,即自己仅保管和访问自己的数据.这也就限制了应用可以访问的本地空间范围.当然了android应用很多就很流氓,他们会去扫别的应用的数据,这种操作至少是不提倡的,因此这边也就不会介绍了.

在nativescript中根据平台的架构不同为不同平台提供了不同的可访问空间,他们都使用[`@nativescript/core`中的文件系统接口](https://docs.nativescript.org/core/file-system#filesystem-api)进行访问.

这其中又分为3个主要接口:

+ [knownFolders](https://docs.nativescript.org/api/namespace/knownFolders)和[Folder](https://docs.nativescript.org/api/class/Folder),提供上面提到的本地空间的文件夹和对应操作
+ [File](https://docs.nativescript.org/api/class/File),提供文件读写操作
+ [path](https://docs.nativescript.org/api/namespace/path),提供路径编辑操作

其中`Folder`和`File`是基类`FileSystemEntity`的子类

### 已知可访问位置

已知可访问位置都保存在`knownFolders`下,它们是比较推荐我们开发中使用的本地路径目录.下面是各平台的已知可访问位置:

| 项目                 | 说明                                                 | 接口                              | android | ios  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------- | ---- |
| 应用的本地根路径     | 当前应用的根目录,项目私有                            | `knownFolders.currentApp()`       | 支持    | 支持 |
| 应用的文档文件夹路径 | 当前应用的文档路径,项目私有                          | `knownFolders.documents()`        | 支持    | 支持 |
| 应用的临时文件夹路径 | 当前应用的临时文件夹路径,项目私有                    | `knownFolders.temp()`             | 支持    | 支持 |
| 应用的桌面文件夹     | `NSDesktopDirectory`文件夹.不存在调用后会被创建      | `knownFolders.ios.desktop()`      | 不支持  | 支持 |
| 应用的开发者文件夹   | `NSDeveloperDirectory`文件夹.不存在调用后会被创建    | `knownFolders.ios.developer()`    | 不支持  | 支持 |
| 应用的下载文件夹     | `NSDownloadsDirectory`文件夹.不存在调用后会被创建    | `knownFolders.ios.downloads()`    | 不支持  | 支持 |
| 应用的链接文件夹     | `NSLibraryDirectory`文件夹.不存在调用后会被创建      | `knownFolders.ios.library()`      | 不支持  | 支持 |
| 应用的电影文件夹     | `NSMoviesDirectory`文件夹.不存在调用后会被创建       | `knownFolders.ios.movies()`       | 不支持  | 支持 |
| 应用的音乐文件夹     | `NSMusicDirectory`文件夹.不存在调用后会被创建        | `knownFolders.ios.music()`        | 不支持  | 支持 |
| 应用的图片文件夹     | `NSPicturesDirectory`文件夹.不存在调用后会被创建     | `knownFolders.ios.pictures()`     | 不支持  | 支持 |
| 应用的共享文件夹     | `NSSharedPublicDirectory`文件夹.不存在调用后会被创建 | `knownFolders.ios.sharedPublic()` | 不支持  | 支持 |

我们可以用`folder.isKnown`来判定一个文件夹是否是已知可访问位置.

### 路径操作

android,ios和普通类unix操作系统使用同样的路径系统,`path`则是处理路径的模块.这个接口比较简单,主要也就是`path.join(oldpath,ext)`这个接口.

而`File`和`Folder`的实例都可以调用属性`.path`获取到对应对象的所在路径.

```ts
import {knownFolders,path} from '@nativescript/core'
path.join(knownFolders.currentApp().path, "data/flick.json")
```

不多赘述,无非就是创建删除等操作,下表给出接口(小写为实例方法,大写为类方法)

| 路径           | `file.path`:string                                                       | `folder.path`:string                                                       |

| 同步删除操作   | `file.removeSync(onError?: (error: any) => any) => void`                 | `folder.removeSync(onError?: (error: any) => any) => void`                 |
| 重命名操作     | `file.rename(newName: string) => Promise<any>`                           | `folder.rename(newName: string) => Promise<any>`                           |

## 数据存储接口

数据存储接口大致分为3类:

+ 类[Web Storage](https://blog.hszofficial.site/TutorialForFront-EndWeb/#/%E6%B5%8F%E8%A7%88%E5%99%A8%E7%8E%AF%E5%A2%83%E7%9A%84%E5%89%8D%E7%AB%AF%E5%BA%94%E7%94%A8/%E6%B5%8F%E8%A7%88%E5%99%A8%E8%B0%83%E7%94%A8%E6%9C%AC%E5%9C%B0%E8%B5%84%E6%BA%90/%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E6%9C%AC%E5%9C%B0%E5%AD%98%E5%82%A8?id=web-storage)的键值对存储接口,用于比较轻量级的数据保存
+ 类[indexed-db](https://blog.hszofficial.site/TutorialForFront-EndWeb/#/%E6%B5%8F%E8%A7%88%E5%99%A8%E7%8E%AF%E5%A2%83%E7%9A%84%E5%89%8D%E7%AB%AF%E5%BA%94%E7%94%A8/%E6%B5%8F%E8%A7%88%E5%99%A8%E8%B0%83%E7%94%A8%E6%9C%AC%E5%9C%B0%E8%B5%84%E6%BA%90/%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E6%9C%AC%E5%9C%B0%E5%AD%98%E5%82%A8?id=indexed-db)的文档型非关系数据库接口,用于保存相对比较大的半结构化数据
+ 类[websql](https://blog.hszofficial.site/TutorialForFront-EndWeb/#/%E6%B5%8F%E8%A7%88%E5%99%A8%E7%8E%AF%E5%A2%83%E7%9A%84%E5%89%8D%E7%AB%AF%E5%BA%94%E7%94%A8/%E6%B5%8F%E8%A7%88%E5%99%A8%E8%B0%83%E7%94%A8%E6%9C%AC%E5%9C%B0%E8%B5%84%E6%BA%90/%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E6%9C%AC%E5%9C%B0%E5%AD%98%E5%82%A8?id=websqlhtml5%e6%9c%aa%e8%a2%ab%e6%94%b6%e5%bd%95)的关系数据库接口,一般用于保存结构化的表格数据


### ApplicationSettings保存键值对型数据


### CouchBase保存半结构化文档数据


### sqlite保存结构化数据

sqlite是一个基于文件的关系数据库,使用SQL语言管理数据,该工具在智能手机时代之前就已经在各种功能机上被广泛使用,无论android还是iphone我们都可以用它管理应用数据.



    在nativescript-vue中我们使用sqlite需要借助插件[nativescript-sqlite](https://github.com/NathanaelA/nativescript-sqlite/blob/master/src/README.md),安装使用命令

    ```bash
    tns plugin add nativescript-sqlite
    ```

    安装好后只要导入即可

我们需要主要修改的依然只有`model`层.主要也是修改`models`目录下的内容

+ `models/Flick_sqlite.ts`,我们改用sqlite保存数据,并提供了`Init`方法用于初始化数据库

    ```ts
    import Sqlite from "nativescript-sqlite";

    const debug = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';

    //FlickModel flick列表中的信息样式
    interface FlickModel {
      id: number
      title: string
      image: string

    //FlickDetail flick详情信息样式
    interface FlickDetail {
      id: number
      genre: string

              `The Book of Mormon was conceived by Trey Parker, Matt Stone and Robert Lopez. Parker and Stone grew up in Colorado, and were familiar with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and its members. They became friends at the University of Colorado Boulder and collaborated on a musical film, Cannibal! The Musical (1993), their first experience with movie musicals. In 1997, they created the TV series South Park for Comedy Central and in 1999, the musical film South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut. The two had first thought of a fictionalized Joseph Smith, religious leader and founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, while working on an aborted Fox series about historical characters. Their 1997 film, Orgazmo, and a 2003 episode of South Park, "All About Mormons", both gave comic treatment to Mormonism. Smith was also included as one of South Parks "Super Best Friends", a Justice League parody team of religious figures like Jesus and Buddha.`

            body: `During the summer of 2003, Parker and Stone flew to New York City to discuss the script of their new film, Team America: World Police, with friend and producer Scott Rudin (who also produced South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut). Rudin advised the duo to see the musical Avenue Q on Broadway, finding the cast of marionettes in Team America similar to the puppets of Avenue Q. Parker and Stone went to see the production during that summer and the writer-composers of Avenue Q, Lopez and Jeff Marx, noticed them in the audience and introduced themselves. Lopez revealed that South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut was highly influential in the creation of Avenue Q. The quartet went for drinks afterwards, and soon found that each camp wanted to write something involving Joseph Smith. The four began working out details nearly immediately, with the idea to create a modern story formulated early on. For research purposes, the quartet took a road trip to Salt Lake City where they "interviewed a bunch of missionaries—or ex-missionaries." They had to work around Parker and Stones South Park schedule. In 2006, Parker and Stone flew to London where they spent three weeks with Lopez, who was working on the West End production of Avenue Q. There, the three wrote "four or five songs" and came up with the basic idea of the story. After an argument between Parker and Marx, who felt he was not getting enough creative control, Marx was separated from the project.[10] For the next few years, the remaining trio met frequently to develop what they initially called The Book of Mormon: The Musical of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. "There was a lot of hopping back and forth between L.A. and New York," Parker recalled.`

The show was directed by Darko Tresnjak and choreography by Peggy Hickey, with Christy Altomare and Derek Klena starring as Anya and Dmitry, respectively.Director Tresnjak explained: "Weve kept, I think, six songs from the movie, but there are 16 new numbers. Weve kept the best parts of the animated movie, but it really is a new musical." The musical also adds characters not in the film. Additionally, Act 1 is set in Russia and Act 2 in Paris, "which was everything modern Soviet Russia was not: free, expressive, creative, no barriers" according to McNally.The musical also omits the supernatural elements from the original film, including the character of Rasputin and his musical number "In the Dark of the Night", although that songs melody is repurposed in the new number "Stay, I Pray You", and introduces instead a new villain called Gleb, a general for the Bolsheviks who receives orders to kill Anya.`

+ `views/Home.vue`,我们在挂载home页面节点前执行数据库初始化和加载数据的操作,在取消挂载节点后执行数据库的关闭函数,同时改用异步方式从数据库中获取数据

    ```ts
    ...
    import { Init,Close,GetFlicks,FlickModel } from './models/Flick'
    ...
    const flicks = ref<FlickModel[]>([]);
    ...
    onBeforeMount(() => {
      Init().then((res) => {
        return GetFlicks()
      }).then((res) => {
        flicks.value = res;
      });
    })

    onUnmounted(() => Close())
    ...
    ```

+ `views/Details.vue`类似的也是改用异步方式从数据库中获取详情

    ```vue
    <template>
    ...
    </template>

    <script lang="ts">
    ...
    import { GetFlickById, FlickDetail } from "../models/Flick";
    interface Data {
      flick: FlickDetail;
    }
    export default Vue.extend({
      props: {
        id: Number,
      },
      data(): Data {
        return {
          flick: {
            id: 0,
            genre: "",
            title: "",
            image: "",
            url: "",
            description: "",
            details: [],
          },
        };
      },
      computed: {
        ...
      },
      mounted: function () {
        GetFlickById(this.id).then((res) => {
          this.flick = res;
        });
      },
    });
    </script>
    ```


#### 使用orm做对象化映射
